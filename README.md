# Computer-Simulation-Solar-System
This was my final project for the course: Computer Simulations, and I loved it. I learnt about different numerical methods, and simulating N-body systems. Read the report included to check how different solvers compare (and I like it cause this was my first research style paper that I wrote, and I always wanted to do that :-)
